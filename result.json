research from UCI as the primary example of how scientific discovery can create transformative outcomes When chemistry professor Sherry Rowland and his postdoc Mario Molina showed that chlorofluorocarbons CFCs deplete ozone they helped to launch a campaign that literally saved the world Following their discovery several changes in policy took effect in the US and in 1987 the world agreed on the Montreal Protocol a global arrangement to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozonedepleting substances Fast forward to 2019 — the ozone hole was the smallest on record since its discovery This inspirational UCI success story continues to shape the university today Among our top priorities is to provide solutions to the problem of climate change an effort that unites our worldclass climate scientists chemists biologists engineers humanities scholars and social scientists as we explore bold ideas in fusion energy carbon

Research Scientists Develop AIEnhanced Video Compression Model See more about how UCI is leading the way in Artificial Intelligence Did You Know UCI and artificial intelligence go way back In 1968 the campus opened the UC system’s first computer science department At the helm was Julian Feldman who had coedited a groundbreaking anthology of AI research articles five years earlier Almost immediately the fledgling department began offering graduate seminars and workshops in artificial intelligence But the lessons were largely theoretical “A lot of the ideas we’re using now were around then” says Padhraic Smyth Chancellor’s Professor of computer science and founding director of the UCI Center for Machine Learning Intelligent Systems from 2007 to 2014 “But they couldn’t pursue them in the 1960s because computers were too primitive” Indeed when Feldman’s book was reissued in 1995 coeditor Edward Feigenbaum wrote the preface on an Apple Macintosh that he said possessed “far more processing power more RAM and more disk memory than the sum of all the computers that were being used by all the AI researchers from 195662” From those humble beginnings ICS faculty and alumni have helped pioneer some of the computing world’s most important advancements including HTTP and the domain name system two cornerstones of the internet An epicenter for California art With the acquisition of The Irvine Museum Collection in 2016 and the addition of The Buck Collection in 2017 UCI has become home to a significant collection of California art To bring these collections together the University founded the UCI Institute and Museum of California Art IMCA in 2018 with plans to construct a new museum facility on campus within the next few years An oncampus museum realizes the original vision for the University of California’s expansion into Irvine in the early 1960s Architect William Pereira 190985 known for his distinctive modernist designs in the California Brutalist style seen throughout the two concentric rings that define the campus included a museum among the main buildings IMCA is delighted to bring this earlier vision to life through a new museum and research institute The museum will serve as an epicenter for California art and artists and engage diverse publics through innovative exhibitions and programs The research institute will support collection research and advance interdisciplinary scholarship and learning opportunities for UCI students faculty and visiting scholars and researchers Through a robust offering of exhibitions and publications research seminars and conferences lectures and artist talks tours and educational outreach IMCA strives to expand our understanding of California’s artistic past and present its distinctive social and cultural

Costa Figueiredo Profile What was it like growing up in Belém in the Amazon region of Brazil The Amazon is very influential in our life as rain cycles and weather are all dictated by the forest It rains almost every day and it’s very hot The city is almost an island surrounded by the river Donald Bren School of Information Computer Sciences Mayara Costa Figueiredo PhD in informatics If you’ve ever used a health app to track your menstrual cycle or count steps you’ll want to follow Mayara Costa Figueiredos research According to a recent Gallup survey 20 percent of US adults employ health apps with highincome households women and young adults among the most enthusiastic users An interest in the intersection of health informatics and humancomputer interaction led Figueiredo from her native Brazil to UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information Computer Sciences where she works under the supervision of Associate Professor Yunan Chen and Professor Kai Zheng in the Health and Informatics Lab Her thesis focuses on understanding the uncertainties women face when selftracking their fertility and how to better support them She interviews patients and healthcare providers analyzes social media and evaluates the design of mobile apps that track fertility You could call her a scientistadvocate for health app users “I love technology but I love people more” Figueiredo says “I want to help people and support their activities as they use technology to gain knowledge about their health” Her analysis of health app utilization illuminates the role of technology in educating individuals about their bodies “People who are trying to conceive often don’t know how their body works” she says Data tracking can empower users but also provoke anxiety and depression if the desired results are not achieved Figueiredo’s goal is for her research to improve the design of selftracking health apps She says “Apps should promote positive behaviors while setting realistic expectations” Laura Rico UCI “I want to help people and support their activities as they use technology to gain knowledge about their health” Mayara Costa Figueiredo Brad Greene Profile Top three sociologists you’d like to meet Max Weber Karl Marx Pierre Bourdieu School of Social Sciences Brad Greene BA in sociology and BA in education sciences The offer of a full athletic scholarship to play basketball definitely piqued Brad Greene’s interest in attending UCI but he was hesitant to make the move from his tightknit PaiuteShoshone reservation in Lone Pine to a big university Those initial concerns were allayed when he visited the campus because “people here made me feel comfortable” Greene says And four years later being named the 202021 Big West Conference Defensive Player of the Year confirmed his decision Strong UCI community connections – both on the court and in the classroom – gave Greene confidence “As a freshman I wasn’t outgoing but my teammates and classmates helped me open up” he says “I’m now at ease sharing my experiences with large groups” His plans to pursue an NBA career after graduation were inspired partly by how he felt when playing at the Bren Events Center “The entire environment was just breathtaking especially during events like homecoming” Greene says “Feeling the energy of students alumni and everyone in the crowd was really special” Pat Harriman UCI “As a freshman I wasn’t outgoing but my teammates and classmates helped me open up I’m now at ease sharing my experiences with large groups” Brad Green Katherine Lingle Profile Favorite choreographers Ohad

school in the ’90s the dean spoke to his class as they were about to graduate “She told us that she expected all of us to have our master’s degrees by the time we were 40 and our doctorates by the time we were 50” Patton recalls “Well I’m a few years behind schedule on getting my doctorate but I’m there now I remembered her words for the last 28 years and they have continued to push me to get my DNP this June” One could say that for Patton earning his doctorate is the capstone achievement of a brilliant career As the chief nurse executive at UCSF Health he’s one of the nation’s most influential nursing administrators And before UC San Francisco he was UCI Health’s chief nursing officer So why go back to school “Personally receiving my doctorate is a huge sense of selfaccomplishment and lets me know that anything is"
